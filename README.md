This is an AI system trained to predict your 100m, 200m and 400m times based on information you provide. This is currently still in the early testing phasees so times can be inaccurate but it is fairly precisice so far. This is a tool used to help sprinters calculate their times at their best potential assuming they run their best race and how improving different aspects of their ability will impact their times.
